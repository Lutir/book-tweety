Welcome to the Book Insight Generator! This fun and educational project utilizes the power of GPT to generate fascinating insights about books and authors, all condensed into tweet-sized nuggets of wisdom. And the best part? It automatically tweets these insights to your Twitter account daily!

## How It Works

2. **GPT Magic**: Our GPT-powered AI gets to work, analyzing the book and author's information.
3. **Tweet Creation**: It crafts a concise and captivating tweet based on the generated insights.
4. **Tweet to Twitter**: Your Lambda function tweets the insight to your Twitter account, delighting your followers with literary gems every day.
